## 🏗️ Building Secure Network Architecture

### The Zero Trust Mindset

**Traditional approach**: "Trust but verify" - once inside the network, you have broad access.

**Zero Trust approach**: "Never trust, always verify" - every request is authenticated and authorized, regardless of origin.

**Why this matters for developers**: Your applications should work securely regardless of network location. Don't assume internal traffic is safe.

### Network Segmentation: Practical Implementation

#### 1. Separate Your Environments

```

#### 2. AWS VPC Design Pattern

```yaml
# Example VPC configuration for a secure web application
Resources:
  # Main VPC with no internet gateway by default (secure by default)
  ProductionVPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16
      EnableDnsSupport: true
      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      Tags:
        - Key: Environment
          Value: production

  # Private subnets for application servers (no direct internet access)
  PrivateSubnetA:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref ProductionVPC
      CidrBlock: 10.0.1.0/24
      AvailabilityZone: !Select [0, !GetAZs '']
      MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false

  PrivateSubnetB:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref ProductionVPC
      CidrBlock: 10.0.2.0/24
      AvailabilityZone: !Select [1, !GetAZs '']
      MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false

  # Public subnets only for load balancers and NAT gateways
  PublicSubnetA:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref ProductionVPC
      CidrBlock: 10.0.101.0/24
      AvailabilityZone: !Select [0, !GetAZs '']
      MapPublicIpOnLaunch: true

  # Database subnets - completely isolated
  DatabaseSubnetA:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref ProductionVPC
      CidrBlock: 10.0.201.0/24
      AvailabilityZone: !Select [0, !GetAZs '']
      MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false
```

**Key Pattern**: By default, nothing can access the internet. You explicitly allow only what's necessary.

## 🔒 Firewall Rules: The Least Privilege Approach

### Common Mistake: Overly Permissive Rules

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Too broad
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-12345678 \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 80 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0  # Allows anyone from anywhere
```

### Better Approach: Specific, Documented Rules

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Specific and documented
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-12345678 \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 80 \
  --source-group sg-87654321  # Only allow from load balancer security group

# For SSH access - use specific IP ranges
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-12345678 \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 22 \
  --cidr 203.0.113.0/24  # Only office network
```

### Firewall Rule Documentation Template

```yaml
# Security Group Rule Documentation
sg_rules:
  web_servers:
    description: "Web application servers"
    rules:
      - port: 443
        source: "load_balancer_sg"
        purpose: "HTTPS traffic from ALB"
        approved_by: "security-team"
        review_date: "2024-03-15"
      - port: 80
        source: "load_balancer_sg"
        purpose: "HTTP redirect to HTTPS"
        approved_by: "security-team"
        review_date: "2024-03-15"
```

## 🌐 Securing Remote Access

### VPN Best Practices for Developers

#### 1. Always Use Multi-Factor Authentication

```bash
# When connecting to company resources via VPN
# Always require: Password + MFA token + Client certificate

# Example VPN client configuration
client dev vpn connect --mfa --certificate
```

#### 2. Split Tunneling Configuration

```yaml
# Only route company traffic through VPN
vpn_config:
  split_tunneling: true
  routes:
    - 10.0.0.0/8      # Company network
    - 192.168.0.0/16   # Company network
    - company.com       # Company domains
  # All other traffic goes through your regular internet
```

**Why this matters**: Prevents all your internet traffic from going through company networks unnecessarily.

## 📊 Network Monitoring for Developers

### What to Monitor in Your Applications

#### 1. Connection Patterns

```python
# Monitor unusual connection patterns in your application
import logging
from datetime import datetime

def monitor_database_connections():
    """Log database connection attempts for security analysis"""
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Log connection attempt
            logging.info(f"DB connection from {get_client_ip()} at {datetime.now()}")

            # Check for unusual patterns
            if is_suspicious_activity():
                security_alert("Unusual DB access pattern detected")

            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@monitor_database_connections()
def get_user_data(user_id):
    # Your database query here
    pass
```

#### 2. Rate Limiting Implementation

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from collections import defaultdict
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

# Simple rate limiting middleware
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_requests=100, window_seconds=3600):
        self.max_requests = max_requests
        self.window_seconds = window_seconds
        self.requests = defaultdict(list)

    def is_allowed(self, client_ip):
        now = time.time()
        # Remove old requests outside the window
        self.requests[client_ip] = [
            req_time for req_time in self.requests[client_ip]
            if now - req_time < self.window_seconds
        ]

        # Check if under limit
        if len(self.requests[client_ip]) < self.max_requests:
            self.requests[client_ip].append(now)
            return True
        return False

rate_limiter = RateLimiter()

@app.before_request
def rate_limit():
    client_ip = request.remote_addr
    if not rate_limiter.is_allowed(client_ip):
        return jsonify({"error": "Rate limit exceeded"}), 429
```

## 🚨 Common Network Security Pitfalls

### 1. Hardcoded Security Groups

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Hardcoded security group IDs
resources:
  app_server:
    security_groups: [sg-12345678]  # What if this changes?
```

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Reference security groups dynamically
resources:
  app_server:
    security_groups:
      - !Ref WebServerSecurityGroup
      - !Ref DatabaseAccessSecurityGroup
```

### 2. Open Database Ports to the Internet

```yaml
# ❌ VERY BAD: Database accessible from internet
database_security_group:
  ingress:
    - cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
      ports: [3306]  # MySQL open to world
```

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Database only accessible from application layer
database_security_group:
  ingress:
    - source_security_group_id: !Ref AppServerSecurityGroup
      ports: [3306]  # Only accessible from app servers
```

### 3. Debug Endpoints in Production

```python
# ❌ BAD: Debug endpoint without protection
@app.route('/debug')
def debug():
    return jsonify(system_info=get_system_info())

# ✅ GOOD: Protected debug endpoint
@app.route('/debug')
@auth_required  # Require authentication
@internal_network_only  # Only accessible from internal networks
@rate_limit(max_requests=10)  # Limit calls
def debug():
    return jsonify(system_info=get_system_info())
```

---

## 🛠️ Network Security Tools for Developers

### 1. Local Network Security Testing

```bash
# Test your application's network security locally
nmap -sS -O your-app.local

# Check for open ports that shouldn't be accessible
netstat -tulpn | grep :8080

# Test firewall rules
curl -v http://your-app:8080/health
```

### 2. Cloud Network Security Validation

```bash
# AWS CLI commands to validate network security
# Check security group rules
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-12345678

# Check VPC flow logs for unusual traffic
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/vpc/flow-logs \
  --filter-pattern "REJECT"

# Validate NACL configurations
aws ec2 describe-network-acls --vpc-id vpc-12345678
```

### 3. Container Network Security

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile security best practices
FROM node:18-alpine

# Create non-root user for network operations
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Only expose necessary ports
EXPOSE 3000

# Don't run as root for network operations
USER nextjs
```

```yaml
# Kubernetes network policy example
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: app-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-application
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: load-balancer
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3000
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: database
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
```
