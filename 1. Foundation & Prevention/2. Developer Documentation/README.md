## Common Security Issues & Quick Fixes

### Most Frequent Security Findings
1. **Hardcoded Secrets** - Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens
2. **SQL Injection** - Use parameterized queries always
3. **Insecure Dependencies** - Keep packages updated and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Debug Mode in Production** - Never ship with debug enabled
5. **Overly Permissive Access** - Follow least privilege principle

### Quick Fixes
```python
# ❌ BAD: Hardcoded secret
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"

# ✅ GOOD: Environment variable
import os
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
```

```python
# ❌ BAD: SQL injection
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# ✅ GOOD: Parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```
