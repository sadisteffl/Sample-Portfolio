# Security Testing

This directory contains comprehensive security testing workflows, validation procedures, and testing resources to ensure our security tools and processes are working effectively.

## Contents

### [Security Testing Guide](SECURITY-TESTING-GUIDE.md)
Step-by-step instructions for testing and verifying GitHub Actions security workflows.

### [Vulnerability Test File](simple-vulnerability-test.py)
Intentionally vulnerable Python file used to test security scanning tools.

## Key Testing Areas

### üß™ Tool Validation
- **Semgrep Testing**: Verify static analysis detects code vulnerabilities
- **TruffleHog Testing**: Ensure secret detection is working
- **Trivy Testing**: Validate vulnerability scanning across file types
- **Pipeline Testing**: Confirm GitHub Actions workflows function correctly

### üîç Security Assessment
- **SAST Validation**: Static Application Security Testing verification
- **DAST Testing**: Dynamic Application Security Testing procedures
- **Container Security**: Docker and Kubernetes security testing
- **Infrastructure Security**: IaC and cloud configuration testing

### üìä Test Results Management
- **Test Data Management**: Secure handling of test vulnerabilities
- **Result Validation**: Confirming tools detect expected issues
- **Reporting**: Documenting test outcomes and improvements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enhancing test coverage and procedures

## Quick Start

1. **Review the Security Testing Guide** - Understand testing procedures
2. **Run Tool Validation** - Test individual security tools
3. **Validate Pipelines** - Ensure CI/CD security workflows work
4. **Document Results** - Record test outcomes and findings

## Testing Best Practices

### Safe Testing Practices
- Use isolated test environments
- Never test with real secrets or production data
- Clean up test artifacts after completion
- Document all testing procedures and results

### Continuous Testing
- Integrate testing into regular development cycles
- Automate test validation where possible
- Maintain up-to-date test cases and examples
- Regular review and improvement of test procedures
