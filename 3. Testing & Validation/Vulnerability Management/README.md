# Vulnerability Management

This directory contains systematic approaches to identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across our entire technology stack.

## Contents

### [Test Security Vulnerabilities](test-security-vulnerabilities.md)
Collection of intentional security vulnerabilities for testing security scanning tools and workflows.

## Vulnerability Management Process

### üîç **1. Discovery & Identification**
- **Automated Scanning**: Continuous security tool scanning
- **Manual Assessment**: Security reviews and penetration testing
- **Third-Party Reports**: External security research and disclosures
- **Threat Intelligence**: Proactive vulnerability monitoring

### üìä **2. Assessment & Classification**
- **Severity Scoring**: CVSS and business impact assessment
- **Risk Prioritization**: Business context and exploitability analysis
- **Asset Classification**: Criticality and data sensitivity mapping
- **Impact Analysis**: Potential damage and exploitation likelihood

### ‚ö° **3. Remediation & Validation**
- **Fix Planning**: Prioritized remediation schedules
- **Patch Management**: Systematic update and fix deployment
- **Validation Testing**: Confirming vulnerabilities are resolved
- **Documentation**: Recording remediation activities

### üìà **4. Monitoring & Reporting**
- **Metrics Tracking**: Vulnerability lifecycle metrics
- **Trend Analysis**: Security posture improvement tracking
- **Compliance Reporting**: Regulatory and audit requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Process optimization and enhancement

## Key Vulnerability Categories

### **Application Security**
- **Injection Flaws**: SQL, NoSQL, command injection
- **Authentication Issues**: Broken auth and session management
- **Access Control**: Authorization and privilege escalation
- **Cryptographic Failures**: Weak encryption and data protection

### **Infrastructure Security**
- **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigured services and platforms
- **Network Vulnerabilities**: Firewall and network security gaps
- **Container Security**: Docker and Kubernetes vulnerabilities
- **Cloud Security**: AWS, Azure, GCP configuration issues

### **Dependency Security**
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: CVEs in third-party libraries
- **Outdated Components**: Unsupported or deprecated software
- **License Compliance**: Legal and policy compliance issues
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Third-party service vulnerabilities

## Metrics & KPIs

### **Detection Metrics**
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Average time to discover vulnerabilities
- **Coverage Rate**: Percentage of assets scanned and monitored
- **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of vulnerability detection

### **Remediation Metrics**
- **Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)**: Average time to fix vulnerabilities
- **Remediation Rate**: Percentage of vulnerabilities resolved within SLA
- **Backlog Management**: Age and size of vulnerability backlog

### **Business Metrics**
- **Risk Reduction**: Overall security risk improvement
- **Compliance Score**: Adherence to security standards
- **Cost Avoidance**: Financial impact of proactive security

## Tools & Integration

### **Scanning Tools**
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for code vulnerabilities
- **Trivy**: Container and dependency scanning
- **TruffleHog**: Secrets detection and scanning
- **Nessus/OpenVAS**: Network and infrastructure scanning

### **Management Platforms**
