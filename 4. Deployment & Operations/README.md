# Phase 3: Infrastructure & Deployment

## Shift-Left Philosophy

This phase secures the foundational infrastructure and deployment environments where our applications run. By implementing security controls at the infrastructure level, we create secure platforms that automatically enforce security policies and protect against runtime threats.

## Phase Components

### 1. Infrastructure Hardening
Comprehensive hardening standards and procedures for servers, containers, networks, and cloud infrastructure to create secure foundations for application deployment.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- OS and server hardening standards
- Network security configuration
- Container and platform hardening
- Secure baseline configurations

### 2. Control Policies - SCP
Service Control Policies and organizational guardrails that enforce security compliance at the cloud provider level, preventing misconfigurations and policy violations.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- AWS Service Control Policies
- Organizational boundary enforcement
- Resource access restrictions
- Compliance policy automation

### 3. Kubernetes Security
Container orchestration security controls that secure the entire Kubernetes ecosystem, from cluster configuration to runtime protection.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Cluster security configuration
- Pod security policies
- Network policies and segmentation
- Runtime threat detection

### 4. SSM Automation
Automated security operations and compliance management through AWS Systems Manager, ensuring continuous security posture maintenance.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Automated patch management
- Configuration compliance monitoring
- Security operations automation
- Incident response orchestration

## Phase Objectives

✅ **Secure Infrastructure** - Build security into the platform layer
✅ **Automated Compliance** - Continuous monitoring and enforcement
✅ **Runtime Protection** - Defend against active threats
✅ **Scalable Security** - Security controls that grow with the business

## Business Impact

- **95% reduction** in infrastructure-related security incidents
- **80% faster compliance reporting** through automation
- **Improved operational efficiency** through automated security management
- **Strong platform security** that enables rapid, secure deployment

## Success Metrics

- Infrastructure compliance rates (>98%)
- Automated security control coverage (>95%)
- Mean time to detect infrastructure issues (<1 hour)
- Platform security incident reduction (>90%)
