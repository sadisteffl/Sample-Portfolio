# Kubernetes Security & Compliance Guide

A comprehensive guide to Kubernetes best practices, ISO 27001 & SOC 2 compliance controls, and container image standards. This repository provides a consolidated checklist for building a secure, resilient, and compliant Kubernetes ecosystem. 

## Kubernetes Best Practices Controls

This section outlines foundational controls for securing  Kubernetes environment. There are many options to managaing the fleet either with open source such as Kyvernno or a vendor. 

### Cluster & API Server Security

* **Upgrade Kubernetes Regularly**: Always run the latest stable version to get the latest security patches.


* **Secure the API Server**:
    * Restrict API server access to trusted networks.
    * Enable **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and use the principle of least privilege.
    * Disable anonymous authentication.
    * Enable audit logging for all API server requests.
* **Secure `etcd`**:
    * Encrypt `etcd` data at rest.
    * Restrict access to the `etcd` cluster to only the API server.
    * Use TLS for all communication with `etcd`.
    * This is already done by a de-facto standard within AWS. However would reccommend for AWS EKS to apply KMS. 
* **Harden Worker Nodes**:
    * Use a minimal, hardened operating system.
    * Restrict SSH access.
    * Regularly scan nodes for vulnerabilities. - Would like to also mention this was in CI-CD so we can stop vulnerabilites before they go out of if a new vulnerability is released developers will not be able to push if its critical or high. 
    * Ensure the kubelet configuration is secure (e.g., disable anonymous auth).


### Pod & Workload Security

* **Implement Pod Security Standards (PSS)**: Use built-in profiles like `baseline` or `restricted`. Avoid the `privileged` profile.
* **Use Secure Container Runtimes**: Employ runtimes with strong isolation capabilities.
* **Network Policies**:
    * Implement network policies to control pod-to-pod traffic.
    * Default to denying all ingress and egress traffic, then explicitly allow necessary communication.
* **Secrets Management**:
    * Don't store secrets in config files or environment variables.
    * Use Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest enabled.
    * Consider a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    * Again, this is also brought up in CI/CD to stop ahead but also would reccommend some sort of vendor to insure the integrity ofour code even after the pushes. 
* **Resource Management**:
    * Define resource requests and limits for all pods to prevent DoS attacks.
    * Use namespaces to isolate resources and environments.

## Compliance Frameworks: ISO 27001 & SOC 2

Map ISO 27001 and SOC 2 principles to specific Kubernetes controls to achieve compliance.

### ISO 27001 Annex A Controls Mapping

| ISO 27001 Annex A Control                | Kubernetes Implementation                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A.5 Information Security Policies** | Define and enforce security policies for the cluster using tools like OPA/Gatekeeper.                                                      |
| **A.6 Organization of Information Security** | Implement strong **RBAC** to define and segregate roles and responsibilities.                                                          |
| **A.8 Asset Management** | Maintain an inventory of all cluster resources (nodes, pods, services) and their owners.                                                   |
| **A.9 Access Control** | Enforce least privilege with **RBAC**, use strong authentication, and manage API server access.                                            |
| **A.12 Operations Security** | Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring, perform regular vulnerability scanning, and have a robust change management process.       |
| **A.13 Communications Security** | Use TLS for all communication. Implement network policies to secure network traffic.                                                       |
| **A.14 System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance** | Integrate security into the CI/CD pipeline. Regularly update and patch Kubernetes components and container images.           |

### SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria for Kubernetes

| SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria | Kubernetes Implementation                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security** | Implement strong access controls (**RBAC**), network policies, and vulnerability management. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.                |
| **Availability** | Use readiness and liveness probes. Configure pod autoscaling. Implement a robust backup and disaster recovery strategy.                                     |
| **Processing Integrity** | Use admission controllers to validate deployments. Use checksums and digital signatures to verify image integrity.                                          |
| **Confidentiality** | Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information. Encrypt data at rest and in transit. Use network policies and **RBAC** to restrict data access.        |
| **Privacy** | Implement controls to protect personally identifiable information (PII) within the cluster, adhering to relevant data protection regulations.             |

## ðŸ“¦ Container Image Standards & Best Practices

The security of  Kubernetes environment starts with secure container images.

Within the imagaes, I would highly reccommend using a vendor which does secure by default image containers. There are several vendors within the space, but its worth pay the extra money in order to get a zero-CVE image. 

### Image Construction

* **Use Minimal Base Images**: Start with trusted, minimal base images (e.g., "distroless" or Alpine) to reduce the attack surface.
* **Don't Run as Root**: Build images that run applications with a non-root user.
* **Remove Unnecessary Tools**: Exclude package managers, shells, and debugging tools from production images.
* **Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to create lean production images without build-time dependencies.

### Image Scanning & Management

* **Scan for Vulnerabilities**: Integrate image scanning into  CI/CD pipeline.
* **Use a Private, Secure Registry**: Store images in a private, trusted container registry with strict access controls.
* **Image Signing**: Implement image signing (e.g., with Cosign) to ensure the integrity and provenance of images.
* **Immutable Images**: Treat container images as immutable. Don't patch running containers; build and deploy a new, patched image.
* **Use Specific Image Tags**: Avoid the `:latest` tag in production. Use semantic versioning or commit hashes to ensure you run specific, tested versions.
