# Standardizing AWS Account Security with a Reusable Terraform Module
Automating AWS Account Hardening for Scalable Security

## The Challenge: Consistent Security at Scale
As the compnay grow's, they will be provisioning new AWS accounts for different environments, projects, and services. A critical challenge is ensuring that every new account has a strong, consistent security baseline from the moment it's created. Manually configuring security settings, especially for user authentication, is error-prone, inefficient, and leads to configuration drift, creating potential security gaps.

My goal is to automate this process to guarantee that every IAM user in any new AWS account is governed by a robust password policy without requiring manual intervention.

## Our Solution: A Versioned IAM Hardening Module
To solve this, there would dedicated and reusable Terraform module which technically would be in its own repo but for the sake of time, I just gave a sample of the code within the same repo. This one ties specifically for enforcing a strong IAM Account Password Policy which is listed in the job titlte and falls under authentication. Although there shouldnt be any users and user should be through SSO and or a role this is still a standard for audits to ensure there is proper password protections. 

This module is a self-contained piece of code that codifies our company's security standards for user passwords. When applied, it automatically configures the new AWS account with the following best-practice policies:

1. Minimum Length: Requires passwords to be at least 14 characters.

2. Complexity: Enforces the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

3. Password History: Prevents users from reusing any of their last 24 passwords.

4. Rotation: Mandates password changes every 90 days.

5. Self-Service: Allows users to change their own passwords, reducing administrative overhead.

These settings are defined as variables within the module and are preset to our security standards, but they can be explicitly overridden if a unique situation requires it.

## How It Works: Centralized, Version-Controlled Security
The most powerful aspect of this solution is its implementation as a version-controlled module.

Centralized Source: The module's code is not copied into each project. Instead, it is stored in its own dedicated Git repository (e.g., on GitHub). This repository is the single source of truth for our account password policy.

Versioning: We use Git tags (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0) to create immutable versions of the module. This is critical. It means we can evolve our security policy over time in a controlled manner. A new account can be pinned to a stable, tested version, and we can roll out updates to the policy across the organization on our own schedule by simply updating the version number in each project's code.

This approach completely decouples our security policy from the individual account provisioning logic, making it highly reusable and easy to maintain.

## Implementation: A "One-Liner" for Hardening
When provisioning a new AWS account with Terraform, applying our entire security standard is now incredibly simple. You just need to add the following module block to the main Terraform configuration:

# In the main.tf for any new AWS account
```
module "account_password_policy" {
  # This source points to our official Git repository for the module.
  # The `ref` argument locks it to a specific, stable version.
  source = "git::https:/EXAMPLE/terraform-aws-iam-password-policy.git?ref=v1.0.0"

  # No other configuration is needed; the module applies our standard policy.
  # In a rare, documented case, you could override a default here:
  # max_password_age = 120
}
```
There would just need to be a git tag with the version number that we call. If we need to transform and develop over time then we tag v2.0.0 and then all the accounts can just call that tag and update every account. 

By including this block, we automatically enforce our entire password policy on the new account.

## Key Benefits
1. Security by Default: Every new account is secure from day one. There is no window for human error.

2. Drastic Efficiency: We've reduced the process of implementing a core security control to a single, simple code block.

3. Consistency & Auditability: Eliminates configuration drift. We can be certain that all accounts adhere to the same standard, which is easy to audit and verify.

4. Centralized Management: If we decide to strengthen our password policy (e.g., increase the minimum length), we only need to update the module in one place, release a new version (v1.1.0), and then incrementally roll it out to our accounts.

This module automates a foundational layer of our cloud security, allowing us to build and scale faster while maintaining a strong and consistent security posture.

There are a lot of modules which should be included in the hardening process which include: 

- IAM Password Policy: Enforces strong password complexity and rotation.

- AWS Config & Conformance Packs: Enables continuous monitoring and compliance checks.

- Centralized CloudTrail: Creates an immutable audit log for all account activity.

- Secure VPC Baseline: Establishes a secure default network with logging.

- Standard IAM Roles: Provides pre-configured, least-privilege roles for users.

- GuardDuty Threat Detection: Activates intelligent monitoring for malicious activity.
