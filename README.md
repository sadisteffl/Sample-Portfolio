# Overview: Sadi's Guidebook to Shifting Left

This guidebook introduces my comprehensive security philosophy: **prevent security issues before they exist** by making secure choices the easiest choices.

My approach uses automation to embed security directly into development workflows, reducing manual overhead and accelerating launch times. The code within this repo is primarily Terraform and Kubernetes YAML, managed via Git, reflecting the tools required for modern security engineering. All standards are designed with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliance requirements built-in.

# Notes

### Cost

Given the opportunity, I would welcome a discussion with the CTO to provide potential pricing for a full implementation or go over other methods and architectural choices.

### Gaps 

I have also identified several areas that are intentionally not fully built out in this sample but would be critical components of a production-ready environment. These are topics I am prepared to discuss in greater detail:

#### Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is crucial because it helps companies find security problems before building anything. Including threat modeling from the start is important because it's dramatically cheaper and more effective to design security in from the beginning than to try and add it on later. It helps build a fundamentally secure application, rather than just patching holes after they've already been built.

#### Data Security & Governance
Data is the lifeblood of an AI company, so its security and governance are a top-level priority, adding a strategic layer beyond foundational controls like Macie and encryption. A robust data governance program is critical for building and maintaining trust. This starts with clear data classification policies to ensure we understand our data's sensitivity and apply the right protections. It also includes disciplined data lifecycle management to responsibly handle information from creation to secure deletion, which is crucial for minimizing risk when managing vast training datasets. Finally, collaborating with the privacy team on Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) is non-negotiable. This allows us to proactively identify and mitigate privacy risks before a product launch, ensuring regulatory compliance and demonstrating a deep commitment to customer trust

#### Runtime Security

Runtime security is crucial because it protects companies's application while it's actually running in a live environment. No matter how well the design and scan of the code are before deployment, it's impossible to predict every possible threat. A brand-new vulnerability might be discovered, or an attacker could find a clever way to exploit a minor misconfiguration that only appears in the live system.

Including runtime security from the start is important because it acts as a final and most critical layer of defense. It actively monitors for suspicious behavior - like a container trying to access a file it shouldn't or an application making unexpected network connections - and can block these threats in real-time. Without it, companies would have a major blind spot and be vulnerable to attacks that static checks and firewalls simply cannot see.

# Conclusion

This guidebook is more than a collection of configurations and code; it's a practical reflection of my core philosophy. I believe that the concepts we learn and the people we meet within our community have a profound effect on our ability to address the world around us. The most successful people - and the most successful companies - are those who accumulate diverse skills, learn from their mistakes, and are always willing to innovate.

My approach to security is guided by a simple, personal principle: every day is a chance to make things better than they were the day before. I see mistakes and vulnerabilities not as failures, but as opportunities for growth. This is why I am so passionate about the "shift-left" model; it's a software-led initiative that bakes learning and improvement directly into the development process. For me, a successful day is one where I've learned something new while helping my team build more secure, resilient systems.

This mindset directly aligns with my mission to drive progress through software. To build world-changing AI, the underlying security function must be a catalyst, not an obstacle. It must be as agile, automated, and forward-thinking as the technology it protects. My goal is to help build that function - one that empowers engineers, automates compliance, and turns every challenge into a chance to improve.
