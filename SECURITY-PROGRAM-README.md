# DevSecOps Program - Complete Security Framework

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive DevSecOps program that implements security throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Our shift-left approach ensures security is built-in from the start, not bolted on at the end.

## üîÑ Shift-Left Security Lifecycle

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Prevention**
Building the security foundation through education, documentation, and preventive controls.

**Key Components:**
- Security training and culture
- Developer documentation and standards
- Security architecture and design principles

### **Phase 2: Design & Development**
Integrating security into the architecture and development processes.

**Key Components:**
- Security tools and coverage strategy
- Development integration and IDE setup
- Security processes and checklists

### **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**
Comprehensive security testing throughout the development lifecycle.

**Key Components:**
- Security testing workflows and validation
- Vulnerability management processes
- Automated and manual testing procedures

### **Phase 4: Deployment & Operations**
Securing the deployment pipeline and production environments.

**Key Components:**
- Infrastructure hardening and configuration
- Container and Kubernetes security
- Runtime protection and monitoring

### **Phase 5: Governance & Compliance**
Security governance framework and compliance management.

**Key Components:**
- Regulatory compliance and risk management
- Security policies and standards
- Audit and assurance processes

### **Phase 6: Operations & Response**
Security operations and incident response capabilities.

**Key Components:**
- Threat intelligence and monitoring
- Incident response and recovery
- Security metrics and reporting

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Security Tools

### **Static Analysis (SAST)**
- **Semgrep**: Code vulnerability scanning and security pattern detection
- **Coverage**: 12+ programming languages, custom security rules

### **Vulnerability Scanning**
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanner for dependencies and containers
- **Coverage**: Filesystem, containers, IaC, license compliance

### **Secret Detection**
- **TruffleHog**: Advanced secret detection across git history and filesystem
- **Coverage**: API keys, tokens, certificates, credentials

### **Infrastructure Security**
- **Custom Policies**: Terraform and CloudFormation security validation
- **Container Security**: Docker and Kubernetes security scanning

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Developers
1. **Read the [Foundation & Prevention](1.%20Foundation%20&%20Prevention/) documentation**
2. **Set up your IDE** following the [Development Integration](2.%20Design-Development/Development%20Integration/) guide
3. **Follow the security checklists** in your daily work
4. **Test security tools** using the [Security Testing](3.%20Testing%20&%20Validation/Security%20Testing/) examples

### For DevOps Engineers
1. **Review the security tools** in [Security Tools & Coverage](2.%20Design-Development/Security%20Tools%20&%20Coverage/)
2. **Implement CI/CD security** using the [Secure Pipeline](2.%20Design-Development/Process%20&%20Checklists/Secure%20CI-CD%20Pipeline.md) guide
3. **Configure infrastructure security** in [Deployment & Operations](4.%20Deployment%20&%20Operations/)
4. **Monitor security metrics** in [Operations & Response](6.%20Operations%20&%20Response/)

### For Security Teams
1. **Understand the program structure** across all phases
2. **Customize security policies** and rules for your organization
3. **Implement governance frameworks** in [Governance & Compliance](5.%20Governance%20&%20Compliance/)
4. **Establish incident response** procedures in [Operations & Response](6.%20Operations%20&%20Response/)
