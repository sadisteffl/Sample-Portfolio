# Third-Party Risk Management Framework

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes comprehensive processes for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with third-party vendors, suppliers, and technology partners. As organizations increasingly rely on external services and software components, a robust third-party risk management program is essential for maintaining security posture, regulatory compliance, and business continuity.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Supply Chain Security** - Ensure all third-party relationships meet security standards
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Meet SOC 2, ISO 27001, and industry-specific requirements
- **Business Continuity** - Manage third-party dependencies and resilience
- **Risk-Based Decisions** - Enable informed vendor selection and ongoing management

**Target Audience:** Procurement teams, security teams, legal departments, and business units engaging with third parties.

## Introduction: The Extended Enterprise Security Challenge

Modern organizations don't operate in isolation. Our security posture extends beyond our own systems to include the security practices of our vendors, suppliers, and technology partners. A single weak link in our supply chain can compromise our entire security program.

This framework provides a structured approach to managing third-party risks throughout the vendor lifecycle, from initial consideration through ongoing relationship management and eventual termination.
