## Introduction: Security as a Customer Value Proposition

In today's security-conscious business environment, customers increasingly evaluate vendors based on their security capabilities and transparency. Rather than treating security as a cost center, we position it as a value proposition that builds customer trust and drives business success.

This program provides customers with visibility into our security practices while maintaining appropriate confidentiality for sensitive security details. It creates a partnership model where security becomes a shared responsibility and competitive advantage.
