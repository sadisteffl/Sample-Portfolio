# Corporate Incident Response Plan

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines the plan and procedures for companies as an example to manage and respond to information security incidents. The purpose of this plan is to ensure a swift, effective, and coordinated response to limit the impact of any security breach, minimize disruption to business operations, and reduce financial and reputational damage. This plan applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to information systems.

## 3. Incident Severity Levels

Incidents will be classified to prioritize response efforts.

## 4. Communication Plan

Timely and accurate communication is essential.

### Internal Communication

* **Incident Response Team:** A dedicated, secure channel (e.g., encrypted chat, conference bridge) will be established immediately upon incident declaration.
* **Executive Leadership:** The Communications Lead will provide regular, concise updates to the Executive Sponsor and other key leaders.
* **All Employees:** General notifications will be sent as needed to inform staff of any impacts to their work or required actions (e.g., password resets).

### External Communication

* **Customers:** All communication will be pre-approved by Legal and the Communications Lead. The focus will be on transparency, providing actionable information, and rebuilding trust.
* **Regulatory Bodies:** Legal Counsel will manage all required notifications to regulatory agencies (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) within the mandated timeframes.
* **Law Enforcement:** The Incident Commander, in consultation with Legal, will determine if and when to engage law enforcement agencies like the FBI.

## 5. Plan Testing and Maintenance

This plan is a living document and must be kept current.

* **Tabletop Exercises:** The Incident Response Team will conduct a tabletop exercise at least **annually** to walk through a simulated incident scenario and identify gaps in the plan.
* **Plan Review:** This document will be reviewed and updated **semi-annually** or after any significant security incident.
* **Contact List Audit:** The contact information for all roles will be audited on a **quarterly** basis to ensure it is accurate.
