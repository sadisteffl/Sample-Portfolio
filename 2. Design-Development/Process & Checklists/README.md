# Process & Checklists

This directory contains security processes, checklists, and compliance requirements for integrating security into the development lifecycle.

## Contents

### [Application Security Checklist](Application%20Security%20Checklist.md)
Comprehensive security requirements and validation steps for application development, ensuring security is considered at every stage.

### [Secure CI-CD Pipeline](Secure%20CI-CD%20Pipeline.md)
Automated security scanning and validation embedded directly into the development pipeline, providing continuous security feedback.

## Security Process Overview

### Development Lifecycle Integration

1. **Planning & Design**
   - Security requirements definition
   - Threat modeling integration
   - Architecture security reviews

2. **Development**
   - Secure coding standards
   - Real-time security feedback
   - Peer security reviews

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Automated security testing
   - Manual security testing
   - Compliance validation

4. **Deployment**
   - Security quality gates
   - Production readiness checks
   - Monitoring setup

## Key Principles

- **Shift-Left Security**: Find and fix issues early in development
- **Automated Validation**: Continuous security testing without manual overhead
- **Developer Enablement**: Tools and processes that enhance developer productivity
- **Compliance by Design**: Built-in compliance requirements and validation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Follow the [Application Security Checklist](Application%20Security%20Checklist.md) for all new features
- Set up local security tools as described in [Development Integration](../Development%20Integration/)
- Participate in security reviews and threat modeling sessions

### For DevOps Engineers
- Implement the [Secure CI-CD Pipeline](Secure%20CI-CD%20Pipeline.md) in your projects
- Configure automated security scanning and quality gates
- Monitor pipeline security metrics and alerts

### For Security Engineers
- Review and update checklists regularly
- Conduct security architecture reviews
- Provide guidance on security tool configuration

## Metrics & KPIs

- **Vulnerability Detection Rate**: >95% of vulnerabilities found in development
- **Mean Time to Fix**: <24 hours for critical security issues
- **Pipeline Success Rate**: >98% of security scans pass
- **Developer Satisfaction**: >85% satisfaction with security tools
