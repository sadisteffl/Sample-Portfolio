# Proposal for a Secure CI/CD Pipeline

I've drafted this document to outline a robust and secure CI/CD pipeline strategy. This approach is designed to embed security into every stage of the development lifecycle, aligning with best practices and preparing us for future compliance needs like ISO 27001 and SOC 2. Addtionally, please not that since I am using my own `git` and we are not making commits to my own, I thought it would be better just to provide the standards of which I would comply to as well as my other resources in the pipeline. 

## Introduction: A Security-First Approach
A modern CI/CD pipeline is the engine of a software company. By building a strong security foundation into it from day one, we can innovate quickly while minimizing risk. This document provides a checklist of foundational security practices for a GitHub-based pipeline.

Crucially, I propose we augment these standard practices by integrating three key types of automated scanning tools directly into the workflows which we can either hire a vendor or find an open-source option. These tools will empower us to "shift security left," catching and remediating potential issues early in the development process rather than late in production.

### Application Vulnerability Scanner (SAST/DAST)
Application Vulnerability Scanner: By automatically scanning the source code (Static Analysis - SAST) and running applications (Dynamic Analysis - DAST) with every build, we can proactively identify and fix common security flaws like injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and insecure authentication before they ever reach users.

### Container Image Scanner
Integrating these scanners provides a multi-layered defense for the code, artifacts, and infrastructure.
Image Scanner: As we increasingly rely on containers, the application's security is tied to the integrity of its base images. An image scanner will inspect every container layer for known vulnerabilities in the operating system and software packages, ensuring we don't build secure applications on a compromised foundation.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Compliance Scanner
IaC & Compliance Scanner: This is a critical component for ensuring the infrastructure is secure and compliant from the start. By scanning the Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) definitions, we can detect misconfigurations before they are deployed. This proactive approach is far more flexible and developer-friendly than relying solely on restrictive, after-the-fact controls like cloud provider Service Control Policies (SCPs). The more compliance checks we can validate here at the code level, the lighter the dependency on the rigid limitations of SCPs becomes.

## Bug Bounty Program
Beyond internal tooling, a mature security program embraces the external security community as a critical partner. Establishing a formal Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) provides a foundational "safe harbor," giving ethical researchers clear, safe guidelines for reporting potential vulnerabilities without fear of legal recourse. This policy creates a structured channel for communication and remediation. To further incentivize and leverage the global talent pool, this VDP can be enhanced with a bug bounty program, rewarding researchers for validated findings. By actively and respectfully working with security researchers, we create an essential, continuous feedback loop that helps uncover and resolve issues that internal processes might miss, completing the picture of a comprehensive and transparent security strategy.

### Access Control & Permissions

| Control ID | Severity | Best Practice / Control | Description | ISO 27001 Annex A | SOC 2 Common Criteria (CC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CICD-AC-01 | High | Enforce Branch Protection Rules | Protect important branches (e.g., main, develop) by requiring status checks to pass before merging, requiring pull request reviews, and restricting who can push to the branch. | A.8.27, A.8.28| CC3.2, CC6.1|
| CICD-AC-02 | Critical | Use Least-Privilege for GITHUB_TOKEN | By default, the GITHUB_TOKEN has broad permissions.Scope its permissions down to the minimum required for each specific job in workflow files.| A.5.15, A.8.2| CC6.1, CC6.5|
| CICD-AC-03 | Medium | Require Signed Commits | Enforce commit signing on protected branches to ensure that code changes originate from a trusted and verified source.| A.8.27| CC3.2|
| CICD-AC-04 | Critical | Secure Self-Hosted Runners | If using self-hosted runners, ensure they are isolated, hardened, patched, and not used for public repositories to prevent code execution vulnerabilities.| A.8.7, A.8.8, A.8.23| CC7.1|

### Secret Management

| Control ID | Severity | Best Practice / Control | Description | ISO 27001 Annex A | SOC 2 Common Criteria (CC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CICD-SM-01 | Critical | Use Encrypted Secrets | Store all secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) as encrypted secrets in GitHub Actions or a dedicated secrets manager (like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault). Never store secrets in plaintext in code or workflow files. | A.5.17, A.8.24 | CC6.1, CC6.7 |
| CICD-SM-02 | High | Limit Secret Exposure | Configure workflows to only expose secrets to the specific steps that need them. Avoid printing secrets to logs, even in masked form. | A.8.2, A.8.25 | CC6.1, Confidentiality |
| CICD-SM-03 | High | Rotate Secrets Regularly | Implement a process for regularly rotating all credentials and secrets used in the CI/CD pipeline. | A.5.17 | CC6.1, CC6.3 |

### Code & Dependency Scanning

| Control ID | Severity | Best Practice / Control | Description | ISO 27001 Annex A | SOC 2 Common Criteria (CC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CICD-SCAN-01 | High | Static Application Security Testing (SAST) | Integrate SAST tools (like GitHub CodeQL) into the pipeline to scan source code for security vulnerabilities on every pull request.| A.8.28| CC7.1|
| CICD-SCAN-02 | High | Software Composition Analysis (SCA) | Use tools like Dependabot to scan for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.Automate pull requests to update vulnerable packages.| A.8.7, A.8.29| CC7.1|
| CICD-SCAN-03 | Critical | Secret Scanning | Enable GitHub's secret scanning feature to automatically detect exposed credentials that have been accidentally committed to the repository. | A.8.28| CC7.1|
| CICD-SCAN-04 | Medium | Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) | For web applications, integrate DAST tools to scan the running application in a staging environment for vulnerabilities before deploying to production. | A.8.29 | CC7.1 |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CICD-PI-01 | High | Pin Third-Party Actions | Pin GitHub Actions to a specific commit SHA instead of a branch or tag. This prevents a malicious update to the action from being automatically pulled into the workflow. | A.8.27, A.5.21| CC3.2, CC7.1|
