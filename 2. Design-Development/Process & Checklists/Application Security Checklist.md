# Application Security Compliance Checklist
This checklist outlines the essential tasks for a security engineer to ensure application code and its deployment environment adhere to company policies and best practices. Each control is mapped to relevant SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria and ISO 27001 Annex A controls to aid in compliance efforts.

## Phase 1: Design & Architecture Review

- Threat Modeling: Participate in design sessions to conduct threat modeling for new features to identify and mitigate potential security flaws before code is written.
SOC 2: CC3.2; ISO 27001: A.14.1.1

-Security Requirements Definition: Define and document specific security requirements for the application, including data classification, authentication, and encryption standards.
SOC 2: CC3.1; ISO 27001: A.14.1.1

- Secure Design Review: Review the proposed architecture to ensure it aligns with security principles like least privilege and defense-in-depth.
SOC 2: CC3.2; ISO 27001: A.14.2.1

- Technology Vetting: Vet all new technologies, frameworks, and cloud services for known vulnerabilities and ensure they can meet the company's security standards.
SOC 2: CC9.2; ISO 27001: A.15.1.2

## Phase 2: Development & Secure Coding
- Secure Coding Standards: Establish, document, and enforce secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP Top 10) relevant to the application's language and framework.
SOC 2: CC8.1; ISO 27001: A.14.2.1, A.14.2.5

- Secrets Management: Ensure developers do not hardcode secrets. Implement and enforce the use of an approved secrets management tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
SOC 2: CC6.1; ISO 27001: A.9.4.1, A.14.2.9

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to scan code for vulnerabilities on every commit or pull request.
SOC 2: CC8.1; ISO 27001: A.14.2.8

- Input Validation & Output Encoding: Verify the application properly validates all user-supplied input and encodes all output to prevent injection attacks.
SOC 2: CC7.2; ISO 27001: A.14.2.5

- Authentication & Session Management: Confirm that authentication mechanisms are robust, using multi-factor authentication (MFA) where required, and that session management is secure.
SOC 2: CC6.1, CC6.2; ISO 27001: A.9.2, A.9.4

- Access Control: Review implementation of authorization logic to ensure it correctly enforces the principle of least privilege.
SOC 2: CC6.3; ISO 27001: A.9.1.2, A.14.1.3

## Phase 3: Dependency & Build Management
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Implement SCA tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in third-party and open-source libraries.
SOC 2: CC9.2; ISO 27001: A.12.6.1, A.14.2.8

- Vulnerability Management Policy: Define a policy for handling discovered vulnerabilities in dependencies, including SLAs for patching based on severity.
SOC 2: CC7.1; ISO 27001: A.12.6.1

- Secure Build Process: Ensure the build environment is secure and that the integrity of build artifacts is maintained (e.g., through code signing).
SOC 2: CC8.1; ISO 27001: A.14.2.2, A.14.2.4

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Configure DAST tools to automatically scan running applications in staging environments to find runtime vulnerabilities.
SOC 2: CC4.2; ISO 27001: A.14.2.8

- Penetration Testing: Coordinate and/or perform regular penetration tests on the application, especially before major releases.
SOC 2: CC4.2; ISO 27001: A.12.6.1, A.18.2.3

- Security Test Cases: Work with QA teams to develop and integrate security-specific test cases into the regular testing suite.
SOC 2: CC8.1; ISO 27001: A.14.2.8

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning: Scan Terraform, CloudFormation, or other IaC scripts for security misconfigurations before deployment.
SOC 2: CC8.1; ISO 27001: A.14.2.1

## Phase 5: Deployment & Operations
- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): Ensure CSPM tools are in place to continuously monitor the cloud environment for misconfigurations.
SOC 2: CC4.1, CC7.1; ISO 27001: A.12.1.2, A.18.2.3

- Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy and tune a WAF to protect the application from common web-based attacks.
SOC 2: CC7.2; ISO 27001: A.13.1.1

- Logging & Monitoring: Verify that comprehensive logging is in place for all security-relevant events and that alerts are configured for suspicious activity.
SOC 2: CC4.1, CC7.3; ISO 27001: A.12.4.1, A.12.4.3

- Hardening: Ensure all underlying infrastructure (servers, containers, databases) is hardened according to industry benchmarks (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).
SOC 2: CC5.3; ISO 27001: A.12.1.2

- Incident Response Plan: Develop and regularly test an incident response plan specific to the application.
SOC 2: CC5.4; ISO 27001: A.16.1
