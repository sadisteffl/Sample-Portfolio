# Phase 2: Design & Development

## Shift-Left Philosophy

This phase focuses on integrating security into the architecture and development processes where we can catch and fix issues early, when they're cheapest and fastest to resolve. We implement automated security controls that work seamlessly with developer workflows.

## Directory Structure

### [Security Tools & Coverage](Security%20Tools%20&%20Coverage/)
Our security tooling strategy and implementation guidance based on a minimal yet comprehensive 3-tool stack.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Tool selection and coverage analysis
- Implementation strategies and best practices
- Open source security tool integration
- Developer workflow optimization

### [Development Integration](Development%20Integration/)
Security tools integration into local development environments and IDEs.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- IDE security setup and configuration
- Local development tool installation
- Real-time security feedback integration
- GitHub Actions and CI/CD integration
- Technology-specific examples and configurations

### [Process & Checklists](Process%20&%20Checklists/)
Security processes, checklists, and compliance requirements for the development lifecycle.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Application security requirements and validation
- Secure CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Development lifecycle security integration
- Compliance checklists and quality gates

## Phase Objectives

✅ **Early Detection** - Find and fix vulnerabilities during development
✅ **Automated Validation** - Continuous security testing without manual overhead
✅ **Developer Feedback** - Real-time security guidance in IDEs and pipelines
✅ **Quality Gates** - Security requirements that must be met before deployment

## Business Impact

- **90% faster vulnerability remediation** when caught in development
- **80% reduction** in production security issues
- **Improved developer productivity** through integrated security tools
- **Consistent security enforcement** across all teams and projects

## Success Metrics

- Vulnerability detection rate in development (>95%)
- Mean time to fix security issues (<24 hours)
- Developer satisfaction with security tools (>85%)
- Pipeline security scan success rates (>98%)
